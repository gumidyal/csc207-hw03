## Contents:
This repository contains all classes for Assignment 3, including two folders inside the src folder:
* csc207 folder (contains all classes for implementing TextBlock interface)
* com folder (containing three folders):
  * com.mcfarevee.groceries (contains many classes for grocery types)
  * com.mcfarevee.shopping (contains one class to simulate a shopping cart)
  * com.mcfarevee.tests (contains one class whose main method tests all other methods)

## Additional note:
We only realized at the very end of the project that it is possible to cast
types from classes we made. We used this technique for some of our merge
method in the Cart class, but we now realize that it would have made many
other parts of our code more efficient to have used earlier.
